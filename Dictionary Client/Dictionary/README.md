This repository contains the code for a client application that connects to a DICT.org server. This project is the first assignment for EECS 3214 in York University.

Note that I only implemented all the functions that are in the DictionaryConnection.java file contained in Dictionary/src/ca/ubc/cs317/dict/net/. The rest of the code goes to their respective authors from the York Computer Science Department.
